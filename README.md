# Learning Stuff

Different little projects to learn languages, libraries and test different stuff.
Why do this ? I'm not often on the same computer, and this experiments will serve myself as future reference. <3<3<3

## Pandas

Different little scripts, programs and data I used to experiment and try new libraries

### Taxes in France

I want to make a script using pandas to find the more efficient way of calculating the taxes to be payed in France, as they work in a "stair" way of working, different definitions and conditions are to be used


### Python Classes

I started following some tutorials to learn to use classes, inheritance and some basic decorations.
The sources of the tutorials are in the comments after the shebang.


## GNU PARALLEL

I just discovered that there is a command that allows to parallelize bash commands,
It was created by Ole Tange in 2011. I installed the version 20170722.
This first try comes from `man parallel_tutorial` included after the installation.

(Pssst, yes i got the tarball and compiled it. The latest version is not available in the repos for ubuntu 16.04)
